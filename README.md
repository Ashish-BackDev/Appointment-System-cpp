# Appointment Booking System
A simple C++ program to manage appointment bookings with functionalities to book, cancel, and view appointments. The system allows users to select time slots, records appointments in a file, and ensures a user-friendly console interface.

### Features:
## Book an Appointment
- Users can choose a time slot (A-M corresponding to 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM) and book it by providing their name.

## Cancel an Appointment
- Users can cancel a previously booked appointment by specifying the slot.

## View Existing Appointments
- Displays the current status of all appointment slots, indicating whether each slot is "Available" or "Booked."

### How It Works
1. Appointment Slots
- Slots are labeled A to M for hours from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM.
- Availability is stored in a file named appointment.dat.

2. File-Based Storage
- Appointments are saved in a file (appointment.dat) to ensure data persists between runs.

3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- The program uses platform-specific commands for clearing the console (cls for Windows and clear for Linux/Mac).

### Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming

### Future Improvements
- Add user authentication for managing appointments.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Integrate with databases for better storage and management.
